Any kind of contribution is welcome. If you are not sure whether your idea is in line with 
the general direction of the project, feel free to submit new Issue first and let's get the discussion started there.

Please follow pre-existing coding style.

Asking questions via creating new Issue is fine also.

When submitting a new Issue for what seems is a bug, please note the version you're running and ideally steps to reproduce.

Make sure to add a comment line line to the changeset saying which Issue it is is fixing, e.g. 'fixes #XYZ' so that the issue can be automatically closed when the associated pull request is merged.

Each pull request should be accompanied by a comment explaining how the change was tested, unless unit tests are provided/updated.
Please make every effort to make most of your changes covered by tests.

For a pull request to be merged, we need the contributor to sign Oracle Contributor Agreement first.
