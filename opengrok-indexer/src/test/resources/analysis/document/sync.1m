.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsync\fR executes the \fBsync\fR system primitive. If the system is to be
stopped, \fBsync\fR must be called to ensure file system integrity. It will
flush all previously unwritten system buffers out to disk, thus assuring that
all file modifications up to that point will be saved. See \fBsync\fR(2) for
details.
